              their next steps toward Christ…together. We’re building a thriving
              volunteer culture that provides next-level kids, students and
              young adult ministries in addition to opportunities for women, men
              and families. The fun and adventure of life transformation is
              happening all across our weekly gatherings, events and groups, one
              relationship at a time.
